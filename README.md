## Project Description

The **Election Vote Calculation System** is a Python-based application designed to streamline the election process. It provides a structured platform for voters to cast their ballots and for organizers to calculate and visualize the results. 

### Key Features:
- **Modular Design:** Built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles for scalability and maintainability.
- **Candidate Management:** Supports multiple political parties, with detailed candidate profiles including name, National Identity Card (NIC) number, age, education, and state/province affiliation.
- **Voting Rules:** 
  - Eligible voters can cast votes for up to three candidates.
  - Voter profiles include name, NIC, age, and state/province.
  - Voting is restricted to adult citizens.
  - Candidates can represent only one state/province, and citizens may vote only within their state/province.
- **Secure and Transparent:** Enforces election rules to ensure fairness and integrity.
- **Result Visualization:** Utilizes the `matplotlib` library to generate clear, intuitive charts displaying vote counts for each candidate.

This system simplifies election management, promotes transparency, and ensures efficient vote tallying and result presentation.
